not told of his plans until after the bombs had dropped, according to multiple people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe top two Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority

in the GOP.\n\nTrump himself had ripped the United States’ involvement in wars in the Middle East as a presidential candidate, and his “Make America Great Again” movement includes many more isolationist voices aligned with his “America First” vision.', 'Those voices were at odds in recent days with GOP hawks who advocated a muscular US role in supporting Israel in its bid to stop Iran

that suggested he had made a final decision on striking Iranian nuclear sites and he thought\na two-week timeline\ncould throw off the Iranians and conceal his plans, according to several sources familiar with what happened.\n\nTrump made the call to issue the statement Thursday as he was set to have lunch with his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been publicly skeptical of US involvement.\n\nShortly after, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, walked into the White House briefing room and followed the president’s orders, signaling to the world that Trump’s mind wasn’t

approval under Article I.\n\nThe official also noted the Trump administration has the support of senior officials in the House and Senate, so the White House believes it is on solid legal ground.\n\nA

(1985–2000)\nIranian Islamists have a long history of sympathizing with the Palestinians.\n\nIn 1949, Iranian ayatollah\nMahmoud Taleghani\nvisited the\nWest Bank\nand was moved by the plight of\nPalestinian refugees\n.\n\n[\n53\n]\nTaleqani then began advocating for Palestinians inside Iran in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAfter the\nSix-Day War\nin 1967, he started raising funds (e.g.\n\nzakat\n) inside Iran to be sent to Palestinians.\n\n[\n53\n]\nThe Iranian government at the time was alarmed at these activities and\nSAVAK\ndocuments indicate that the government believed that the Iranian public was sympathetic to the Palestinian people.\n\n[\n54\n]\nLikewise\nRuhollah Khomeini\nchampioned the Palestinian people before he became\nIrans Supreme Leader\nin 1979.\n\nHe also criticized the\nPahlavi dynasty\ns ties with Israel, viewing Israel as a supporter of the Pahlavi regime.', '[\n55\n]\nFollowing the 1979\nIranian revolution\n, Khomeinis new government adopted a policy of hostility towards\nIsrael\n.\n\nThe new Iranian government saw\nIsrael as a colonial outpost\n.\n\n[\n56\n]\nIran withdrew recognition of Israel as a state, and severed all diplomatic, commercial and other ties with Israel,\n[\n57\n]\nreferring to its government as the \nZionist\nregime\n[\n58\n]\nand Israel as \noccupied Palestine\n.\n\nDespite the tension between the two countries,\nIsrael provided support to Iran\nduring the\nIran–Iraq War\nfrom 1980 to 1988.\n\nDuring the war, Israel was one of the main suppliers of military equipment to Iran and also provided military instructors.\n\nIsrael gave direct support to Irans war effort when it bombed and destroyed Iraqs Osirak nuclear reactor in\nOperation Babylon\n.\n\nThe nuclear reactor was considered a central component of Iraqs nuclear weapons program.', '[\n59\n]\nThe\n1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon\nresulted in the departure of the\nPalestine Liberation Organization\n(PLO) from\nLebanon\n.\n\nThe ensuing Israeli\noccupation of Southern Lebanon\ntemporarily benefited Israeli\nallies in Lebanon\nand the civilian Israeli population with fewer violent attacks on Northern Israel by Hezbollah than previously by PLO in the 1970s.\n\n[\ncitation needed\n]\nHowever, the\nwholesale massacres\nperpetrated by Israeli proxies (the Maronite\nLebanese Forces\nand right-wing\nPhalangists\n) against\nLebanese Shias\nhad as a long-term consequence the emergence of a homegrown Lebanese, rather than Palestinian, resistance movement within South Lebanon, which by the second half of the 1990s was posing more strategic trouble to Israel than the PLO could pose in the 1970s.', '[\n60\n]\n[\n61\n]\nIran has established a network of allies and proxy forces across the Middle East, which it describes as part of an \naxis of resistance\n aimed at opposing US and Israeli interests in the area.\n\nIsrael views Iran as an existential threat on account of Tehrans rhetoric, its support for proxy forces in the region, and its arming and financing of Palestinian groups such as\nHamas\n.\n\n[\n62\n]\nIn some cases, proxy groups evolved into political parties, a transition that was both encouraged and nurtured by Iran.\n\nThese dual-role proxies earned political legitimacy while masking terrorist activities.\n\n[\n63\n]\nU.S. intelligence officials said they believe Iran does not seek a broader conflict, arguing that the primary goal of Iranian proxies is to target Israel and the United States in a way that avoids triggering a large-scale war.',

Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAccording to the report the goal is to compel Israel to defend on multiple fronts simultaneously, reducing its ability to focus on Iranian nuclear or military capabilities and pressure Israel indirectly.\n\n[\n70\n]\nHistory\nRelationship with PLO\nStarting in the 1960s, many Iranians (both leftist and religious) had volunteered to fight against Israel with various Palestinian organizations, including the\nPalestinian Liberation Organization\n(PLO).', '[\n71\n]\nSome of these volunteers, who had received training in Lebanon and Jordan, then returned to Iran to

Arafats visit, Iran severed ties with Israel and expelled Israeli diplomats.\n\n[\n71\n]\nThe PLO found Irans revolution inspiring, given that\nKhomenei\n, who had been exiled from his homeland, defeated a militarily powerful enemy supported by the US, something that the PLO thought it could replicate against Israel.\n\n[\n72\n]\nOn the other hand, Palestinians felt\nArab nationalism\nwas at a dead end.\n\n[\n72\n]\nArabs were defeated in the\n1967 war\n, Jordan\nexpelled the PLO in 1970\nand\nEgypt recognized Israel in 1978\n.', '[\n72\n]\n[\n71\n]\nDuring the\nIran hostage crisis\n, the PLO attempted to mediate with the Iranian students, but failed.\n\n[\n73\n]\nIn addition, secret documents were allegedly discovered at the US embassy detailing Israeli support for the Shahs regime.\n\n[\n74\n]\nAt the start of the\nIran-Iraq war\n, Yasser Arafat tried to mediate between\nSaddam Hussein\nand Khomenei.\n\n[\n75\n]\nArafat feared the war would distract from the Palestinian cause.\n\n[\n75\n]\nArafat travelled personally on 20 September 1980, to Baghdad and Tehran, but his efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nArafat eventually sided with Iraq during the war.\n\n[\n76\n]\nDespite this, Iranian leaders kept a pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n[\n77\n]\nIran under Khomeini (1979–1989)\nFollowing the\nIranian Revolution\nand the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, Iran adopted a sharp anti-Israel stance.\n\nIran cut off all official relations with Israel.', '[\n57\n]\nIran also ceased to accept Israeli passports, and the holders of Iranian passports were banned from travelling to the occupied Palestine.\n\n[\n78\n]\nThe\nIsraeli Embassy in Tehran\nwas closed and handed over to\nthe PLO\n.\n\n[\n79\n]\nAyatollah Khomeini\ndeclared Israel an \nenemy of

Lebanese parties\n, helping to consolidate them into a single political and military organization,\nHezbollah\n, and providing them the ideological indoctrination, military training and equipment to attack Israeli and American targets.\n\n[\n81\n]\nIsraeli occupation of Lebanon\nIn 1982,\nIsrael invaded Lebanon\n.\n\nThe leaders of the Lebanese Shia community appealed to Iran for help.', '[\n82\n]\nKhomeini sent his defense minister and military leaders to Syria to assist, however he eventually concluded that Iran could not fight a two-front war given its ongoing war with Iraq.\n\n[\n83\n]\nDespite Israeli success in eradicating PLO bases and partial withdrawal in 1985, the Israeli invasion had actually increased the severity of\nconflict with local Lebanese militias\nand resulted in the consolidation of several local Shia Muslim movements in Lebanon, including\nHezbollah\nand\nAmal\n, from a previously unorganized guerrilla movement in the south.\n\nOver the years, military casualties of both sides grew higher, as both parties used more modern weaponry, and Hezbollah progressed in its tactics.\n\nIran supplied the militant organization Hezbollah with substantial amounts of training, weapons, explosives, financial, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid while persuading Hezbollah to take action against Israel.', '[\n84\n]\n[\n85\n]\n[\n86\n]\nHezbollahs 1985 manifesto listed among its four main goals Israels final departure from Lebanon as a prelude to its final obliteration.\n\n[\n87\n]\nAccording to reports

the US inserts itself into Israel’s war against Iran with strikes on nuclear sites\n1 of 9\n|\nThe U.S. military struck three sites in Iran early Sunday, the mission called “Operation Midnight Hammer” involved decoys, deception and was met with no Iranian resistance, according to the Sunday morning Pentagon news briefing by Hegseth and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.', 'Read More\n2 of 9\n|\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel is “very close” to achieving its goals in the war with Iran.\n\nThe Prime Minister added that he knew in advance about the U.S. strikes on Iran.\n\nRead More\n3 of 9\n|\nThe world grappled Sunday with the enormous implications after the United States inserted itself into Israel’s war against Iran with an attack that raised urgent questions about what remained of Tehran’s nuclear program and how its weakened military might respond.\n\nRead More\n4 of 9\n|\nDaily life in Tehran appeared largely unaffected Sunday, after U.S. strikes on nuclear and military sites in Iran and as exchanges between Iran and Israel continue.\n\nNo disruption to electricity, water or basic services were reported and some residents have now returned to the city after fleeing last week.', '(AP Video: Saeed Sarmadi)\nRead More\n5 of 9\n|\nThis satellite picture by Planet Labs PBC shows Iran’s underground nuclear enrichment site at Fordo following U.S. airstrikes targeting the facility, on Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\n(Planet Labs PBC via AP)\nRead More\n6 of 9\n|\nProtesters chant slogans as one of them holds up a poster of the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a protest following the U.S. attacks on nuclear sites in Iran, in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\n(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\nRead More\n7 of 9\n|\nPresident Donald Trump speaks from the East Room of the White House in Washington, Saturday, June 21, 2025, after the U.S. military struck three Iranian nuclear and military sites, directly joining Israel’s effort to decapitate the country’s nuclear program, as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth listen.', '(Carlos Barria/Pool via AP)\nRead More\n8 of 9\n|\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian attends a protest following the U.S. attacks on nuclear sites in Iran, in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\n(AP Photo/Vahid Salemi)\nRead More\n9 of 9\n|\nA B-2 bomber arrives at Whiteman Air Force Base Mo., Sunday, June 22, 2025.\n\n(AP Photo/David Smith)\nRead More\nBy\nJON GAMBRELL\n,\nFARNOUSH AMIRI\n,\nCARA ANNA\n,\nDAVID RISING\nand\nAAMER MADHANI\nUpdated 7:58 AM GMT+5:30, June 23, 2025\nShare\nShare\nFacebook\nCopy\nLink copied\nPrint\nEmail\nX\nLinkedIn\nBluesky\nFlipboard\nPinterest\nReddit\nFollow AP’s live updates on the Israel-Iran war\n.', 'DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The world grappled Sunday with the United States inserting itself into\nIsrael’s war\nby\nattacking Iranian nuclear sites\n, an operation that raised urgent questions about what remained of Tehran’s nuclear program and how its weakened military might respond.\n\nExperts warned that worldwide efforts to contain\nthe spread of nuclear weapons\nby peaceful means would be at stake in the days ahead, while fears of a wider regional conflict loomed large.\n\nThe\nprice of oil rose\nas financial markets reacted.\n\nIran lashed out at the U.S. for crossing “a very big red line” with its\nrisky gambit\nto strike the three sites with missiles and 30,000-pound\nbunker-buster bombs\n.', 'Iran’s U.N. ambassador, Amir Saeid Iravani, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that the U.S. “decided to destroy diplomacy,” and that the Iranian military will decide the “timing, nature and scale” of a “proportionate response.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi flew to Moscow to coordinate with close ally Russia.\n\nTens of thousands of American troops are based in the Middle East.\n\nAli Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said any country used by the U.S. to strike Iran ”will be a legitimate target for our armed forces,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported.\n\nRelated Stories\nGeneva talks end without resolution to Israel and Irans weeklong war\nUS-Iran talks over Tehrans nuclear program wont happen after Israel strikes\nTrump faces new test after Israeli strikes on Iran\nAt first, the Trump administration indicated it wanted to restart diplomatic talks with Iran.', '“Let’s meet directly,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with CBS.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. “does not seek war.”\nBut President Donald Trump, who has warned of additional strikes if Tehran retaliates against U.S. forces, later mused about the\npossibility of “regime change\n in Iran.\n\nThe U.S. strikes, confirmed by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, hit the\nFordo and Natanz enrichment facilities, as well as the Isfahan nuclear site\n.\n\nIran and the U.N. nuclear watchdog said there were no immediate signs of radioactive contamination around them.\n\n0:00 / 1:53\nAP AUDIO: US inserts itself into Israel-Iran war and strikes 3 Iranian nuclear sites\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports the US inserts itself into Israel-Iran war and strikes 3 Iranian nuclear sites.', 'Trump asserted on his Truth Social platform that Iran’s nuclear sites sustained “monumental damage” in the attack, though an American assessment on the strikes is still underway.\n\n“The biggest damage took place far below ground level.\n\nBullseye!!\n\n!” he wrote.\n\nTrump previously claimed the U.S. “completely and fully obliterated” the sites, but the Pentagon reported “sustained, extremely severe damage and destruction.” Israeli army spokesman Effie Defrin said “the damage is deep,” but an assessment with the U.S. continued.\n\n“We are very close to achieving our goals” in removing Iran’s nuclear and missile threats, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Sunday.\n\nU.S. defense officials have said they are working to determine about just how much damage the strikes did.', 'Iran as well has not said how much damage was done in the attack, though Tehran has not offered any details so far on the strikes it has faced from Israel in its war with that country.\n\nThe head of the U.N.s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, told the Security Council that no one was in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordo, which is dug deep into a mountain, but visible craters tracked with the U.S. announcements.\n\nHe said IAEA inspectors should be allowed to look at the sites.\n\nThe IAEA’s governing board planned an emergency meeting Monday.\n\nGrossi stressed that a path for diplomacy remained, but if that fails, “violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels,” and global efforts at nuclear nonproliferation “could crumble.”\nSatellite images analyzed Monday by The Associated Press appear to show at least one crater at the Natanz site.', 'A hole of around 5 meters (16 feet) could be seen in images taken by Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies on Sunday after the American strikes.\n\nThat hole sits directly over the underground portion of the site, which includes centrifuge halls.\n\nIran has offered no assessment of how much damage has been done at the site.\n\nPrevious Israeli strikes destroyed an above-ground centrifuge hall, as well as all of the power equipment at the site, likely cutting its electrical supply.\n\nWith the attack that Washington said was\ncarried out without detection\n, the United States\ninserted itself into a war\nit spent decades trying to avoid.\n\nSuccess could mean ending Iran’s nuclear ambitions and eliminating the last significant state threat to the security of Israel, its close ally.\n\nFailure — or overreach — could plunge the U.S. into another\nlong and unpredictable conflict\n.', 'For Iran’s supreme leader, it could mark the end of a campaign to transform the Islamic Republic into a greater regional power that holds enriched nuclear material a step away from weapons-grade levels.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\nlast spoke publicly on Wednesday, warning the U.S. that strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.”\nIran, battered by Israel’s largest-ever assault on it that\nbegan on June 13\n, has limited\noptions for retaliation\n, as\nkey allies have mostly stayed out\nof the conflict.\n\nIt could attack U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East with the missiles and rockets that Israel hasn’t destroyed.\n\nIt could attempt to close a key bottleneck for global oil supplies, the Strait of Hormuz, between it and Oman.\n\nOr it could hurry to develop a nuclear weapon with what remains of its program.', 'The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said its program will not be stopped.\n\nNew questions about Iran’s nuclear stockpile\nIran has long maintained that its nuclear program was peaceful, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran is not actively pursuing a bomb.\n\nHowever, Trump and Israeli leaders have argued that Iran could quickly assemble a nuclear weapon.\n\nIsrael has significantly degraded Iran’s air defenses and offensive missile capabilities and damaged its nuclear enrichment facilities.\n\nBut only the U.S. military has the bunker-buster bombs that officials believe offered the best chance of destroying sites deep underground.\n\nA total of 14\nof the bombs\nwere used on Natanz and Fordo, according to the Pentagon.\n\nExperts scrambled to answer the urgent question: What has happened to Iran’s stockpile of uranium and centrifuges?', 'Satellite images taken by Planet Labs PBC after the U.S. strikes, analyzed by The Associated Press, show damage to the facility.\n\nOther images from Maxar Technologies suggest Iran packed the entrance tunnels to Fordo with dirt and had trucks at the facility ahead of the strikes.\n\nSeveral Iranian officials, including Atomic Energy Organization of Iran spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, have claimed Iran removed nuclear material from targeted sites.\n\nBefore the Israeli military campaign began, Iran said it had declared a third, unknown site as a new enrichment facility.\n\n“Questions remain as to where Iran may be storing its already enriched stocks … as these will have almost certainly been moved to hardened and undisclosed locations, out of the way of potential Israeli or U.S. strikes,” said Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute focused on nonproliferation issues.\n\nGlobal leaders responded with shock\nand calls for restraint.', 'Egypt warned of “grave repercussions” for the region.\n\nBahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s Middle East-based 5th Fleet, called on Iran and the U.S. to “quickly resume talks.”\nThe State Department advised U.S. citizens worldwide to “exercise increased caution.”\nTrump’s decision and the risks\nThe decision to attack was a\nrisky one for Trump\n, who won the White House partly on the promise of\nkeeping America out of costly foreign conflicts\n.\n\nBut Trump also vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n\nHe initially hoped that the threat of force would bring the country’s leaders to give up its nuclear program.\n\nFor Netanyahu, the strikes were the culmination of a decades-long campaign to get the U.S. to strike Israel’s chief regional rival and its disputed nuclear program.', 'Netanyahu praised Trump, saying his decision “will change history.”\nIsrael is widely believed\nto be the only Middle Eastern country with nuclear weapons, which it has never acknowledged.\n\nIran and Israel trade more attacks\nIsrael’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Eyal Amir, called the U.S. attack a key “turning point” but added: “We still have targets to strike and objectives to complete.”\nIran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a\nbarrage of 40 missiles at Israel\n, including its Khorramshahr-4, which can carry multiple warheads.\n\nIsraeli authorities said more than 80 people suffered mostly minor injuries.\n\nLate Sunday, the Israeli military said it again struck military infrastructure sites in Tehran and western Iran.\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed other attacks on Iran late Sunday which included strikes on Hamedan and Kermanshah in western Iran, as well as strikes in Tehran, Iran’s capital.', 'Israel also hit what its military described as a missile production site in Shahroud.\n\nEarlier, explosions boomed in Bushehr, home to Iran’s only nuclear power plant, three semiofficial media outlets reported.\n\nIsrael’s military said it struck missile launchers in Bushehr, Isfahan and Ahvaz, as well as a command center in the Yazd area where it said Khorramshahr missiles were stored.\n\nIran has not acknowledged losses of military materiel in the war so far.\n\nIranian state media reported air defense systems were firing in Tehran early Monday, while explosions could be heard in the nearby city of Karaj.\n\nA social media account associated with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, published a propaganda post Monday portraying missile strikes on a darkened city with a giant skull bearing the Star of David on it.\n\n“The punishment continues,” the poster read.', 'Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 950 people and wounded 3,450 others, according to the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists.\n\nThe group said of those dead, it identified 380 civilians and 253 security force personnel.\n\nIn Israel, at least 24 people have been killed and over 1,000 wounded.\n\nAt Turkey’s border with Iran, one departing Iranian defended his country’s nuclear program.\n\n“We were minding our own business,” Behnam Puran said.\n\n___\nThis version corrects that the Strait of Hormuz is between Iran and Oman, not the United Arab Emirates.', '___\nAssociated Press writers Christopher Weber in Los Angeles; Nasser Karimi, Mehdi Fattahi and Amir Vahdat in Iran; Aamer Madhani in Morristown, New Jersey; Julia Frankel in Jerusalem; Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel; Lolita Baldor in Narragansett, Rhode Island; Samy Magdy in Cairo; Rusen Takva in Van, Turkey; Joah Boak in Washington; Edith M.

International Security published satellite images taken by Airbus it assessed showed trucks dumping soil into tunnels at the site on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. attack likely targeted the tunnel entries, the

Fordo enrichment facility before the American strike.', 'That may have been to protect the sites from the strikes.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. cruise missile strike at the Isfahan site likely destroyed its
